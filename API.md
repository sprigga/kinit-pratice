# API Container Activation Issue and Resolution

**Problem:**
The API container (`car-api`) failed to start due to an `OperationalError: (1045, "Access denied for user 'oa-admin'@'145.10.0.1' (using password: YES)")`. This indicated that the API service was unable to connect to the MySQL database with the provided credentials for the `oa-admin` user. The traceback showed that this error occurred during the application startup, specifically when trying to connect to Redis and cache table names, which in turn required a database connection.

**Solution:**
The issue was resolved by addressing the MySQL user permissions and database schema initialization:

1.  **Create MySQL User and Grant Permissions:**
    *   The `oa-admin` user was created in the MySQL container with the password 'Bdfrost168' and granted all privileges on the `oa` database from any host (`%`).
    *   Commands executed:
        *   `docker exec car-mysql mysql -uroot -p'Y05os@5352' -e "CREATE USER 'oa-admin'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'Bdfrost168';"`
        *   `docker exec car-mysql mysql -uroot -p'Y05os@5352' -e "GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON oa.* TO 'oa-admin'@'%';"`
        *   `docker exec car-mysql mysql -uroot -p'Y05os@5352' -e "FLUSH PRIVILEGES;"`
    *   The user creation was verified by querying `mysql.user` table.

2.  **Initialize Database Schema:**
    *   Initially, `docker exec car-api python main.py init --env dev` failed with an `alembic.util.messaging.Target database is not up to date` error.
    *   This was resolved by marking the database as up-to-date using `alembic stamp head`:
        `docker exec car-api bash -c "cd /app && alembic --name dev stamp head"`
    *   After stamping the head, the database initialization command was re-run successfully:
        `docker exec car-api python main.py init --env dev`

3.  **Restart API Container and Verify Connection:**
    *   The API container was restarted: `docker restart car-api`
    *   Verification steps confirmed the fix:
        *   `docker logs car-api --tail 20` showed the API service starting successfully.
        *   `docker exec car-mysql mysql -u'oa-admin' -p'Bdfrost168' -e "USE oa; SHOW TABLES;"` confirmed that all necessary tables were created in the `oa` database.
        *   Accessing `http://localhost:9000/docs` showed the Swagger UI, indicating the API was running and accessible.

The API container is now healthy and able to connect to the MySQL database, and the database schema is correctly initialized.
