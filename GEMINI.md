## 2.5. IT Service Request Module (`api/apps/bpm/it`)

This module within the API service handles the management of IT service requests, integrating with an external BPM (Business Process Management) system. It follows a layered architecture, separating concerns into models, schemas, parameters, CRUD operations, services, and views.

### 2.5.1. Data Access Layer (CRUD) (`api/apps/bpm/it/crud/`)

This directory contains the Data Access Layer (DAL) for the BPM IT service demand module. These files are responsible for interacting with the database for the `BpminIt` and `BpminItDetail` models.

*   **`__init__.py`**:
    *   **Purpose**: This is the package initialization file. It makes the `BpminItDal` and `BpminItDetailDal` classes directly importable from the `api.apps.bpm.it.crud` package.
    *   **Content**:
        ```python
        from .bpmin_it import BpminItDal
        from .bpmin_it_detail import BpminItDetailDal
        ```
        This simply imports the two DAL classes from their respective files within the same directory.

*   **`bpmin_it.py`**:
    *   **Purpose**: This file defines the `BpminItDal` class, which is the Data Access Layer for the `BpminIt` model. It handles database operations related to IT service demand records.
    *   **Class: `BpminItDal`**
        *   Inherits from `core.crud.DalBase`, providing common DAL functionalities.
        *   **`__init__(self, db: AsyncSession)`**:
            *   Initializes the DAL instance with an asynchronous SQLAlchemy session (`db`).
            *   Sets `self.model` to `models.BpminIt`, indicating which database table this DAL interacts with.
            *   Sets `self.schema` to `schemas.BpminItSimpleOut`, which is used for serializing the data returned from database operations.
        *   **`async def update_data_by_serial_number(self, serial_number: str, data_dict: Dict[str, Any]) -> Any`**:
            *   **Purpose**: This asynchronous method updates an existing `BpminIt` record in the database based on its `serial_number`.
            *   **Process**:
                1.  It first queries the database to find the `BpminIt` object matching the provided `serial_number`.
                2.  If no object is found, it raises an exception.
                3.  If found, it iterates through the `data_dict` (a dictionary of key-value pairs) and updates the corresponding attributes of the `BpminIt` object.
                4.  It calls `await self.flush(obj)` to persist the changes to the database. `flush` is used instead of `commit` to allow the calling function (higher layer) to manage the transaction's commit or rollback.
                5.  Finally, it returns the updated data, serialized using `self.schema` if available, otherwise returns the raw object.

*   **`bpmin_it_detail.py`**:
    *   **Purpose**: This file defines the `BpminItDetailDal` class, which is the Data Access Layer for the `BpminItDetail` model. It handles database operations related to the detailed records of IT service demands.
    *   **Class: `BpminItDetailDal`**
        *   Inherits from `core.crud.DalBase`.
        *   **`__init__(self, db: AsyncSession)`**:
            *   Initializes with an `AsyncSession`, sets the model (`models.BpminItDetail`) and schema (`schemas.BpminItDetailSimpleOut`).
            *   Currently, this class only provides the basic CRUD operations inherited from `DalBase` and does not have any custom methods defined within it, similar to `BpminItDal`'s `update_data_by_serial_number`.

### 2.5.2. Data Models (Schemas) (`api/apps/bpm/it/schemas/`)

This directory contains Pydantic models that define the data structures for the IT service demand module. These models are crucial for:

*   **Data Validation**: Ensuring that incoming data (e.g., from API requests) conforms to expected types and formats.
*   **Data Serialization**: Converting Python objects (like SQLAlchemy models) into formats suitable for API responses (e.g., JSON).
*   **Data Deserialization**: Converting incoming data (e.g., JSON from API requests) into Python objects.

*   **`__init__.py`**:
    *   **Purpose**: This is the package initialization file. It allows you to import the Pydantic models directly from the `api.apps.bpm.it.schemas` package, making them easily accessible throughout the application.
    *   **Content**:
        ```python
        from .bpmin_it import BpminIt, BpminItSimpleOut
        from .bpmin_it_detail import BpminItDetail, BpminItDetailSimpleOut
        ```
        This imports the main and simplified output schemas for both `BpminIt` and `BpminItDetail`.

*   **`bpmin_it.py`**:
    *   **Purpose**: Defines the Pydantic models for the `BpminIt` (IT Service Demand) entity.
    *   **Class: `BpminIt(BaseModel)`**
        *   This is a Pydantic `BaseModel` that defines the core fields for an IT service demand. These fields typically correspond to the columns in the `BpminIt` database table.
        *   Each field is defined with its name, type hint (e.g., `str | None`), and a `Field` object from Pydantic. The `Field` object allows adding metadata like `title` (a human-readable description of the field).
        *   **Fields include**: `it_manager`, `dept`, `apply_date`, `extension`, `fillman`, `main_apply_item`, `sub_apply_item`, `request_desc`, `it_undertaker`, `treatment`, `create_user`, `update_user`, `delete_user`, and `serial_number`. All are optional (`| None`).
    *   **Class: `BpminItSimpleOut(BpminIt)`**
        *   This model extends `BpminIt`, meaning it inherits all its fields.
        *   **`model_config = ConfigDict(from_attributes=True)`**: This is a Pydantic V2 feature. `from_attributes=True` enables "ORM mode," which allows Pydantic to read data directly from arbitrary class instances (like SQLAlchemy model instances) by attribute names, rather than requiring them to be dictionaries. This is essential for serializing database query results.
        *   **Additional Fields**: It adds fields that are typically generated by the database or the ORM, such as:
            *   `id: int = Field(..., title="編號")`: The primary key, marked as required (`...`).
            *   `create_datetime: DatetimeStr = Field(..., title="創建時間")`: The creation timestamp, using a custom `DatetimeStr` type (likely a string representation of datetime).
            *   `update_datetime: DatetimeStr = Field(..., title="更新時間")`: The last update timestamp.
            *   `is_delete: bool = Field(False, title="是否軟刪除")`: A boolean flag for soft deletion.

*   **`bpmin_it_detail.py`**:
    *   **Purpose**: Defines the Pydantic models for the `BpminItDetail` (IT Service Demand Detail) entity.
    *   **Class: `BpminItDetail(BaseModel)`**
        *   This `BaseModel` defines the core fields for the detailed aspects of an IT service demand.
        *   **Fields include**: `work_desc`, `rsn` (reference serial number), `status`, `create_user`, `update_user`, and `delete_user`. All are optional.
    *   **Class: `BpminItDetailSimpleOut(BpminItDetail)`**
        *   Extends `BpminItDetail`, inheriting its fields.
        *   **`model_config = ConfigDict(from_attributes=True)`**: Enables ORM mode for serialization from database instances.
        *   **Additional Fields**: Similar to `BpminItSimpleOut`, it adds database-generated fields:
            *   `id: int = Field(..., title="編號")`
            *   `create_datetime: DatetimeStr = Field(..., title="創建時間")`
            *   `update_datetime: DatetimeStr = Field(..., title="更新時間")`

### 2.5.3. Query Parameters (Params) (`api/apps/bpm/it/params/`)

This directory contains classes that define and handle query parameters for API endpoints related to the IT service demand module. These classes are designed to work with FastAPI's dependency injection system to parse and validate parameters from incoming HTTP requests, especially for filtering, searching, and pagination.

*   **`__init__.py`**:
    *   **Purpose**: This is the package initialization file. It makes the `BpminItParams` and `BpminItDetailParams` classes directly importable from the `api.apps.bpm.it.params` package.
    *   **Content**:
        ```python
        from .bpmin_it import BpminItParams
        from .bpmin_it_detail import BpminItDetailParams
        ```
        This simply imports the parameter classes from their respective files.

*   **`bpmin_it.py`**:
    *   **Purpose**: Defines the query parameters that can be used when querying `BpminIt` (IT Service Demand) records.
    *   **Class: `BpminItParams(QueryParams)`**
        *   Inherits from `core.dependencies.QueryParams`, which likely provides a base structure for handling common query parameters like pagination and potentially other filtering mechanisms.
        *   **`__init__(self, serial_number: str | None = Query(None, title="表單序號"), apply_date: str | None = Query(None, title="申請日期"), it_undertaker: str | None = Query(None, title="IT承辦人"), params: Paging = Depends())`**:
            *   This is the constructor, designed to be used as a FastAPI dependency.
            *   **`serial_number`, `apply_date`, `it_undertaker`**: These are defined as optional query parameters using `fastapi.Query`. `Query(None, title="...")` means they are optional and will have a default value of `None` if not provided in the URL. The `title` provides a description for API documentation (e.g., Swagger UI).
            *   **`params: Paging = Depends()`**: This indicates that the `Paging` dependency (from `core.dependencies`) will be injected. `Paging` likely handles pagination parameters like `page` and `page_size`.
            *   **`super().__init__(params)`**: Calls the constructor of the parent `QueryParams` class, passing the `Paging` object, which presumably initializes pagination-related attributes.
            *   **Parameter Processing**: The `__init__` method then processes the received query parameters and stores them as attributes of the `BpminItParams` instance.
                *   `self.serial_number = ("like", serial_number)`: Stores the `serial_number` with a "like" operator hint, suggesting it will be used for a partial string match in the database query.
                *   `self.apply_date = ("date", apply_date) if apply_date else None`: Stores the `apply_date` with a "date" operator hint if provided, suggesting it will be used for date-specific filtering.
                *   `self.it_undertaker = ("like", it_undertaker)`: Stores the `it_undertaker` with a "like" operator hint.
            *   These processed attributes are then typically used by the DAL (Data Access Layer) to construct dynamic database queries.

*   **`bpmin_it_detail.py`**:
    *   **Purpose**: Defines the query parameters for `BpminItDetail` (IT Service Demand Detail) records.
    *   **Class: `BpminItDetailParams(QueryParams)`**
        *   Inherits from `core.dependencies.QueryParams`.
        *   **`__init__(self, params: Paging = Depends(), rsn: str = Query(None, description="參照序號"))`**:
            *   Similar to `BpminItParams`, it takes `Paging` as a dependency.
            *   **`rsn: str = Query(None, description="參照序號")`**: Defines an optional query parameter `rsn` (reference serial number) with a description.
            *   **`self.rsn = rsn`**: Stores the `rsn` directly. This parameter would likely be used to filter detail records associated with a specific main IT service demand.

### 2.5.4. Database Models (`api/apps/bpm/it/models/`)

This directory contains SQLAlchemy ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) models. These models define the structure of the database tables, mapping Python classes and their attributes to database tables and their columns. They are the foundation for interacting with the database using SQLAlchemy.

*   **`__init__.py`**:
    *   **Purpose**: This is the package initialization file. It makes the `BpminIt` and `BpminItDetail` SQLAlchemy models directly importable from the `api.apps.bpm.it.models` package. This simplifies imports in other parts of the application (e.g., in CRUD operations or API routes).
    *   **Content**:
        ```python
        from .it import BpminIt
        from .it_detail import BpminItDetail
        ```
        This imports the two main model classes from their respective files within the same directory.

*   **`it.py`**:
    *   **Purpose**: Defines the SQLAlchemy ORM model for the `Bpmin_it` database table, which stores information about IT service request forms.
    *   **Class: `BpminIt(BaseModel)`**
        *   **`BaseModel`**: This class inherits from `db.db_base.BaseModel`. `BaseModel` is likely a custom base class that provides common functionalities for all SQLAlchemy models in the project, such as primary key (`id`), creation/update timestamps (`create_datetime`, `update_datetime`), and soft deletion (`is_delete`).
        *   **`__tablename__ = "Bpmin_it"`**: This class attribute explicitly sets the name of the database table that this model maps to.
        *   **`__table_args__ = ({'comment': 'IT service request form'})`**: This provides additional arguments for the table definition. Here, it adds a comment to the database table, describing its purpose.
        *   **Column Definitions (using `Mapped` and `mapped_column`)**:
            *   SQLAlchemy 2.0 style is used with `Mapped` and `mapped_column` for defining columns.
            *   `Mapped[str | None]`: This indicates that the Python attribute (`it_manager`, `dept`, etc.) maps to a database column that stores a string (`str`) and can be `None` (nullable).
            *   `mapped_column(String(100), comment="IT經理")`: This specifies the database column's properties:
                *   `String(100)`: The data type in the database (VARCHAR with a maximum length of 100 characters).
                *   `comment="IT經理"`: A comment for the column in the database schema, providing a human-readable description.
            *   **Key Fields**:
                *   `it_manager`, `dept`, `apply_date`, `extension`, `fillman`, `main_apply_item`, `sub_apply_item`, `request_desc`, `it_undertaker`, `treatment`, `serial_number`: These represent the core data fields of an IT service request.
                *   `datediff: Mapped[float | None] = mapped_column(Float, comment="處理天數")`: A column to store the number of days for processing, as a floating-point number.
                *   `create_user`, `update_user`, `delete_user`: These are common audit fields, storing the user IDs responsible for creation, update, and deletion.
        *   **`column_config` Dictionary**:
            *   **Purpose**: This is a custom dictionary (not part of SQLAlchemy's core ORM functionality) that provides metadata for frontend generation. It's likely used by an automated code generation tool or a dynamic form/list rendering component in the web frontend.
            *   **Structure**: It's a dictionary where keys are the model's attribute names (e.g., `'id'`, `'it_manager'`). Each value is another dictionary containing configuration for that field:
                *   `'label'`: The display name for the field in the UI (e.g., '編號', 'IT經理').
                *   `'field_type'`: The type of input field to render (e.g., `'input'`, `'date'`, `'textarea'`).
                *   `'show_in_list'`: A boolean indicating whether this field should be displayed in a list view.
                *   `'show_in_search'`: A boolean indicating whether this field should be available for searching/filtering.
                *   `'required'`: A boolean indicating if the field is mandatory for input.
            *   This configuration allows the frontend to dynamically build forms, tables, and search interfaces without hardcoding each field's properties.

*   **`it_detail.py`**:
    *   **Purpose**: Defines the SQLAlchemy ORM model for the `Bpmin_it_detail` database table, which stores detailed records or history related to IT service requests.
    *   **Class: `BpminItDetail(BaseModel)`**
        *   Inherits from `db.db_base.BaseModel`, similar to `BpminIt`.
        *   **`__tablename__ = "Bpmin_it_detail"`**: Sets the table name.
        *   **`__table_args__ = ({'comment': 'IT service request details'})`**: Adds a table comment.
        *   **Column Definitions**:
            *   `work_desc: Mapped[str | None] = mapped_column(String(500), comment="工作描述")`: A description of the work performed or a specific detail.
            *   `rsn: Mapped[str | None] = mapped_column(String(50), comment="參照序號")`: A reference serial number, likely linking back to the main `BpminIt` record.
            *   `status: Mapped[str | None] = mapped_column(String(50), comment="狀態")`: The status of this specific detail or work item.
        *   **`column_config` Dictionary**:
            *   Similar to `BpminIt`, this dictionary provides frontend configuration for the `BpminItDetail` fields, enabling dynamic UI generation for these detail records.

### 2.5.5. Business Logic (Services) (`api/apps/bpm/it/services/`)

This directory contains the "service layer" for the IT service demand module. This layer is responsible for implementing the business logic, orchestrating interactions between the Data Access Layer (DAL) and external systems (like the BPM WebService), and preparing data for presentation to the API.

*   **`__init__.py`**:
    *   **Purpose**: This file serves two main purposes:
        1.  **Path Configuration**: It dynamically adds the `../../../../utils` directory (which resolves to `api/utils`) to Python's `sys.path`. This allows modules within the `services` directory (and potentially other parts of the `api` application) to import utilities like `bpm_wsdl` without complex relative imports.
        2.  **Service Class Imports**: It imports the main service classes (`BpminItServices` and `BpminItDetailServices`) from their respective files, making them easily accessible when the `api.apps.bpm.it.services` package is imported.
    *   **Content**:
        ```python
        import sys
        import os
        # 添加 utils 路徑到 sys.path，讓整個 services 模塊都可以導入 utils 中的模塊
        utils_path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '../../../../utils')
        sys.path.insert(0, utils_path)

        from .bpmin_it import BpminItServices
        from .bpmin_it_detail import BpminItDetailServices
        ```

*   **`bpmin_it.py`**:
    *   **Purpose**: This file defines the `BpminItServices` class, which encapsulates all business logic related to IT service requests, including interactions with the local database and the external BPM (Business Process Management) system.
    *   **Conditional Import of BPM WSDL Module**:
        ```python
        try:
            from utils.bpm_wsdl import bpm_wsl
            import zeep
            BPM_AVAILABLE = True
        except ImportError as e:
            BPM_AVAILABLE = False
            print(f"Warning: bpm_wsdl module or its dependencies not available. Error: {e}. BPM functionality will be limited.")
        ```
        This block attempts to import the `bpm_wsl` module (which handles BPM WebService communication) and its dependency `zeep`. If the import fails (e.g., `zeep` is not installed or `bpm_wsdl.py` is missing), `BPM_AVAILABLE` is set to `False`, and a warning is printed. This allows the application to run even if BPM integration is not fully set up, gracefully degrading functionality.
    *   **Mapping Dictionaries**:
        *   `SUB_APPLY_ITEM_MAPPING`, `APPLY_ITEM_MAPPING`, `TREATMENT_MAPPING`, `COMPLETE_STATUS_MAPPING`: These dictionaries define mappings between internal "code" values (e.g., `ad_account`) and human-readable "display names" (e.g., `AD帳號申請`).
        *   `_REVERSE_MAPPING` dictionaries: These are automatically generated reverse mappings, allowing conversion from display names back to codes.
        *   **Purpose**: These mappings are crucial for presenting user-friendly information in the frontend and for converting user input back into internal codes for database storage or BPM system interaction.
    *   **Helper Methods (Classmethods)**:
        *   `_get_bpm_client()`: A private helper method that returns an instance of the `bpm_wsl` client. It raises an `ImportError` if `BPM_AVAILABLE` is `False`, ensuring that BPM-dependent functions fail gracefully if the module isn't loaded.
        *   **Code-to-Display Name Conversion (`_get_..._display_name`)**:
            *   `_get_apply_item_display_name`, `_get_sub_apply_item_display_name`, `_get_treatment_display_name`, `_get_complete_status_display_name`: These methods take an internal code (or a comma/semicolon-separated string of codes) and convert it into its corresponding human-readable display name(s) using the reverse mapping dictionaries. They handle cases where multiple items are present in a single string.
        *   **Display Name-to-Code Conversion (`_get_..._code`)**:
            *   `_get_sub_apply_item_code`, `_get_apply_item_code`, `_get_treatment_code`, `_get_complete_status_code`: These methods perform the reverse operation, converting display names back into their internal code representations. They also handle comma/semicolon-separated input.
        *   `_calculate_processing_days(db, serial_number, apply_date)`: Asynchronously calculates the number of days between the `apply_date` and the `create_datetime` of the *latest* `BpminItDetail` record associated with the given `serial_number`.
        *   `_get_latest_processing_status(db, serial_number)`: Asynchronously fetches the `status` from the most recent `BpminItDetail` record for a given `serial_number`.
        *   `_calculate_elapsed_days(apply_date)`: Calculates the number of days elapsed from the `apply_date` to the current system time.
        *   `_process_data_for_output(data)`: This is a critical method for data transformation. It takes a single dictionary or a list of dictionaries (representing `BpminIt` records) and performs a deep copy. Then, it iterates through specific fields (`main_apply_item`, `sub_apply_item`, `treatment`, `is_delete`) and converts their internal code values into human-readable display names using the appropriate mapping functions. This ensures that data sent to the frontend is user-friendly.
        *   `_format_bmp_response(success, data, method, error)`: A utility method to standardize the format of responses returned from BPM WebService calls, including success status, data, the method called, and any error messages.
    *   **BPM WebService Related Methods**:
        *   These are asynchronous class methods that act as wrappers around the `bpm_wsl` client's functions. They call the corresponding BPM WebService method and then format the result using `_format_bmp_response`.
        *   Examples include: `accept_work_item`, `fetch_todo_work_item`, `check_work_item_state`, `complete_work_item`, `get_all_xml_form` (gets full form data), `fetch_proc_instance_with_serial_no` (gets simple form data), `reexecute_activity` (re-process/return), and `get_wsdl_fun_list` (lists available WSDL functions).
    *   **IT Service Request Form Data Processing**:
        *   `_extract_it_form_data(bpm_data, serial_no)`: Parses the complex XML-like structure returned by BPM's `get_all_xml_form` to extract specific fields relevant to the IT service request (e.g., `ItManager`, `Dept`, `ApplyDate`). It uses regular expressions to find values within XML tags.
        *   `create_it_request_from_bpm(db, serial_no, auto_create)`: This method orchestrates the creation of a local `BpminIt` record from BPM data. It first fetches the full form data from BPM, then extracts the relevant fields, and if `auto_create` is true, it uses `crud.BpminItDal` to save the new record to the local database. It also handles error reporting.
    *   **Traditional CRUD Operations**:
        *   `create_bpmin_it(db, data)`: Creates a new IT service request record in the local database using `crud.BpminItDal`.
        *   `get_bpmin_it(db, data_id)`: Retrieves a single IT service request record by ID. It uses a custom SQLAlchemy query to ensure all records (including soft-deleted ones, indicated by `is_delete=True`) are considered, and then processes the output using `_process_data_for_output`.
        *   `list_bpmin_it(db, params_dict)`: Retrieves a list of IT service request records. It also uses a custom query to include all records. Crucially, before returning, it calculates `datediff`, `elapsed_days`, and `latest_processing_status` for each item, and then applies `_process_data_for_output` to convert codes to display names.
        *   `update_bpmin_it(db, data_id, data)`: Updates an existing IT service request record by ID.
        *   `update_bpmin_it_by_sn(db, serial_number, data)`: A specialized update method that updates the `treatment` field of an IT service request. It first attempts to get the `treatment` value from the BPM system; if not found there, it uses the value provided in the `data` parameter.
        *   `update_case_close_status(db, serial_number)`: This method checks the status of a BPM process. It fetches the activity list from BPM and specifically looks for the "使用者測試" (User Test) activity. If this activity is found and its state is "closed.completed", it updates the `is_delete` field of the corresponding local `BpminIt` record to `True`, effectively marking it as closed.
        *   `delete_bpmin_it(db, ids, soft_delete)`: Deletes IT service request records. It supports both soft deletion (marking `is_delete=True`) and hard deletion (actual removal from the database) via the `soft_delete` parameter.

*   **`bpmin_it_detail.py`**:
    *   **Purpose**: This file defines the `BpminItDetailServices` class, which handles business logic for the detailed records (history/steps) of IT service requests.
    *   **Class: `BpminItDetailServices`**:
        *   It provides standard asynchronous CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for `BpminItDetail` records:
            *   `create_bpmin_it_detail(db, data)`: Creates a new detail record.
            *   `get_bpmin_it_detail(db, data_id)`: Retrieves a single detail record by ID.
            *   `list_bpmin_it_detail(db, params_dict)`: Retrieves a list of detail records. It includes logic to filter by `rsn` (reference serial number), which links details to their main IT request.
            *   `update_bpmin_it_detail(db, data_id, data)`: Updates an existing detail record.
            *   `delete_bpmin_it_detail(db, ids, soft_delete)`: Deletes detail records, supporting both soft and hard deletion.
        *   These methods primarily delegate the actual database operations to `crud.BpminItDetailDal` and wrap the results in a standardized success/error dictionary.

### 2.5.6. API Endpoints (Views) (`api/apps/bpm/it/views.py`)

This file defines the API endpoints (routes) for the IT service demand module using the FastAPI framework. This file acts as the "controller" or "view layer" in an MVC-like architecture. Its primary responsibilities are:

*   **Defining API Routes**: Mapping HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and URL paths to specific Python functions.
*   **Request Handling**: Parsing incoming request data (query parameters, form data, JSON bodies).
*   **Dependency Injection**: Utilizing FastAPI's `Depends` system to inject necessary components like database sessions, authentication information, and parsed query parameters.
*   **Delegating Business Logic**: Calling methods in the `services` layer to perform the actual business operations.
*   **Response Formatting**: Returning standardized `SuccessResponse` or `ErrorResponse` objects based on the outcome of the service layer calls.
*   **Error Handling**: Catching exceptions and returning appropriate error responses.

*   **Imports and Setup**:
    *   `from apps.vadmin.auth.utils.current import OpenAuth, AllUserAuth`: Imports authentication dependencies. `OpenAuth` likely means authentication is required, and `AllUserAuth` might be for endpoints accessible to all authenticated users.
    *   `from core.database import db_getter`: Imports a dependency that provides an asynchronous database session (`AsyncSession`).
    *   `from fastapi import Depends, Query, APIRouter, Form`: Core FastAPI components for dependency injection, query parameters, routing, and form data.
    *   `from sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio import AsyncSession`: Type hint for asynchronous database sessions.
    *   `from apps.vadmin.auth.utils.validation.auth import Auth`: Type hint for the authenticated user object.
    *   `from utils.response import ErrorResponse, SuccessResponse`: Custom response classes for consistent API output.
    *   `from . import schemas, models, params, crud, services`: Relative imports for the local module's components (Pydantic schemas, SQLAlchemy models, query parameters, CRUD operations, and business services).
    *   `from core.dependencies import IdList`: A custom dependency likely used to parse a list of IDs from query parameters for bulk operations.
    *   `app = APIRouter()`: Initializes a FastAPI `APIRouter` instance. This allows grouping related endpoints and applying common prefixes or dependencies.

*   **Common Patterns in Endpoints**:
    *   **Decorator (`@app.<method>("/path", summary="...")`)**: Each function decorated with `@app.get`, `@app.post`, etc., becomes an API endpoint.
        *   `summary`: Provides a short description for API documentation (e.g., Swagger UI).
    *   **Dependencies (`Depends`)**:
        *   `p: params.BpminItParams = Depends()`: For GET requests, query parameters (e.g., `serial_number`, `apply_date`) are automatically parsed and validated into an instance of `BpminItParams`.
        *   `data: schemas.BpminIt`: For POST/PUT requests, the incoming JSON request body is automatically validated against the `BpminIt` Pydantic schema.
        *   `serial_no: str = Form(...)` or `user_id: str = Query(...)`: For form data (POST) or individual query parameters (GET), `Form` and `Query` are used to extract and validate values. `...` indicates a required parameter.
        *   `auth: Auth = Depends(OpenAuth())` or `db: AsyncSession = Depends(db_getter)`: These dependencies are injected into the endpoint function, providing the authenticated user's context (including the database session `auth.db`) or a direct database session.
        *   `ids: IdList = Depends()`: Used for endpoints that accept a list of IDs (e.g., for bulk deletion).
    *   **Request Body (`data: schemas.BpminIt`)**: Explain how Pydantic schemas are used to validate incoming JSON request bodies.
    *   **Form Data (`Form(...)`)**: Explain how `Form` is used to parse data from `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` or `multipart/form-data` requests.
    *   **Error Handling (`try-except`)**: Each endpoint is wrapped in a `try-except` block to catch potential exceptions during processing. If an error occurs, an `ErrorResponse` is returned with a descriptive message.
    *   **Response Handling**:
        *   The view functions call methods in the `services` layer (e.g., `services.BpminItServices.list_bpmin_it`).
        *   The service methods typically return a dictionary with a `success` boolean, `data`, `message`, and `error` fields.
        *   The view function then checks `result['success']` and returns either `SuccessResponse` (with `data`, `message`, `count` if applicable) or `ErrorResponse` (with `message`).
